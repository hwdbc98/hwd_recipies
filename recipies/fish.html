    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are plenty of reasons to get excited for warmer weather, but we’d 
        say that grilling fish is pretty high up there. The best grilled fish 
        recipes are deeply flavorful—plus delightfully quick to make and easy 
        on the cleanup.</p>
    <p>You probably already know that a touch of char can make the plainest 
        salt-and-peppered fish fillet taste better. These recipes, though, 
        deliver even more. You'll find the marinades and sauces that help 
        salmon, halibut, and snapper shine, plus smart ways to tackle fish 
        skewers, cedar plank grilling, and whole fish too.</p>
